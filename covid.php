            <p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the Summit Street Executive Board has been taking steps to ensure member safety above all-else. From adapting to a digital format for rehearsals to switching to digital-first productions, our primary focus has been on continuing to make music without jeopardizing the health of our members. We are continuing to make adjustments as the situation continues to evolve both globablly and locally, and are following the guidelines outlined by University, state, and federal health officials.</p>
